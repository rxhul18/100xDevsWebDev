# 100xDevs Web Development Cohort ðŸš€

Welcome to my **100xDevs Web Development** repository! This repo contains all the projects, code, and assignments I have worked on as part of the **100xDevs Web Development Cohort** led by **Harkirat Singh**.

## What's Inside ðŸ“‚

Each week of the cohort is organized into its own subfolder, where you'll find:
- **Project Code:** Implementation of various web development projects.
- **Assignments:** Solutions to assignments and exercises.
- **Learning Notes:** Important concepts and techniques covered during the week.

Feel free to explore the folders to see what I've been working on and how my skills have developed throughout the program.
