# Custom Promise Implementation Project 🚀

This repository contains the assignment project where I created and implemented my own version of the **Promise** class in JavaScript. This project was part of an assignment to deepen my understanding of asynchronous programming and how promises work under the hood.

## Project Overview 🛠️

- **Custom Promise Implementation:** The core focus of this project is the creation of a custom `Promise` class that mimics the behavior of JavaScript's native promises.
- **Usage and Examples:** The project includes examples of how this custom promise can be used in various scenarios to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Testing with Jest:** All functionalities of the custom promise have been thoroughly tested using the **Jest** testing framework to ensure correctness and reliability.

Feel free to explore the code and tests to understand how the custom promise works and how it has been validated.
